## Introduction and Motivation
This repo was created as project for CPSC-473: Introduction to Data Mining course. 
For the course I, @iamgauravsatija, and my project partner, @TheLostLight, created a simple anomaly detection python project.
Out of vast variety of anomaly detection techniques available we picked Guassian Distribution. The reason why we selected Guassian Distribution is because it is a very popular, easy to explain and implement. If you are interested in more about this check outh the [report](Project-Report) below.

## System Requirements

To run the code you need to have following things installed on you machine:
 * python3
 * pandas
 * numpy 
 * matplotlib



## Instructions

To run the code follow the follwoing steps:

> Open terminal <br>
> Navigate to the location where the folder/opython code is <br>
> AnomalyDetectionProject gauravsatija$ python3 AnomalyDetection_stat.py
